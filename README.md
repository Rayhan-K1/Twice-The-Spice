# Twice The Spice – Restaurant Ordering Website

**Twice The Spice** is a commercial restaurant website that lets customers browse the menu and place orders online.  

This repository contains the front-end implementation for the site, built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

---

## Overview

The goals of the project were to:

- Give the restaurant a clean, modern online presence
- Make it easy for customers to **see the menu**, **place an order** and **make a reservation**
- Keep the implementation lightweight (no heavy frameworks) and easy to host

Typical user journey:

1. Land on the homepage and see key navigation to dishes page.
2. Browse through menu sections
3. Add items to an order and review the selection.
4. Submit the order via the provided flow

> 🔧 This is a commercial project, so only the front-end implementation is included here.
